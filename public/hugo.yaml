    content: |-
     I'm David Rutkevich, a high school student driven by the potential of artificial intelligence to transform industries and shape our future. My passion lies in developing practical AI solutions that solve real-world problems, particularly in the realm of healthcare and scientific research.

     With a foundation in Python, I've delved into projects ranging from disease detection using computer vision to applying AI for economic analysis. My work on blood cell analysis earned me a publication in a scientific journal, and  I was a winner of the national Jugend Forscht competition in Germany. These experiences have cemented my love of taking an idea from research and prototyping all the way to a functional system.
